> R-Type Game Project Overview

## Introduction

Language: C++

Description:
This advanced C++ project focuses on the development of a networked video game, providing an introduction to game networking and offering an exploration into advanced development techniques and best software engineering practices.

Objective:
The aim is to recreate the legacy video game 'R-Type'. The challenge is to develop a multithreaded server, a graphical client, and a personalized game engine. The development is split into two phases: initially creating the core game architecture and a working prototype, followed by an enhancement phase where specific features can be added.

About R-Type:
R-Type is a renowned Horizontal Shmup (Shoot'em'up) game. Although not the pioneer of its genre, it gained immense popularity in the 90s, leading to various ports, spin-offs, and modern remakes.
